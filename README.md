# Genetics data handling
## About
Handling of SNP datasets with HDF - Dosage converter, LD pruning, filtering, merging and saving to hdf format. Was created as part of my work 2018-2020 and some scripts have dataset-specific names. Not maintained (apart from refactoring)

#### Update 2023
Folder dosageconverter is in the process of refactoring - object oriented programming, hexagonal software architecture

Other functions will be added - LD pruning, filtering, merging and saving to hdf format
